# HideFaces.AI
Author: Tomasz Palczewski

## Motivation for this project format:
- “Dealing with privacy, both legal requirements and social norms, is hard but necessary” John Hanke, director of Google Earth and Google Maps

- Extremely hard task that has not been really fully solved so far as even one missed detection may have a huge legal consequences

## Main Goal

- My main goal was to build a pipeline that tests different Deep Learning algorithms available on the market and study their efficiency / misclassification examples for the specific task of face anonymization

## Setup
- Clone repo
```
git clone https://github.com/tpalczew/HideFaces.git
cd HideFaces
```

## Requisites
- To download all needed requisites
```
pip install -r build/requirements.txt
```



## Test
- Include instructions for how to run all tests after the software is installed
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Run Inference
- Include instructions on how to run inference
- i.e. image classification on a single image for a CNN deep learning project
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```


## Serve Model
- Include instructions of how to set up a REST or RPC endpoint
- This is for running remote inference via a custom model
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Analysis
- Include some form of EDA (exploratory data analysis)
- And/or include benchmarking of the model and results
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```
